# BeZen-Data-Science-Assignment
by **Anmol Jindal**.

### Introduction
The assignment has been implemented on Google Colab so that anyone can run it on his/her device regardless of the system configuration.</br>
Since the dataset is huge, exhaustive use of Pandas library has been used.</br>
Also, for better visualisation, graphs have been plotted using Matplotlib wherever necessary.</br>

### How to Run ? 
1.) navigate to Bezen_DataScience.ipynb file in the repo.</br>
2.) In the python notebook, you'll see a 'open in collab' button. Click on it.</br>
3.) The notebook will open in Google Colab. Just make sure you are signed in and connected to runtime.</br>
4.) Now simply run each cell to get the desired output.</br>
